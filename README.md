# Electrionic-Billing-system
It is a program written in a ATMEL studio to count the automated pulses and work with the GSM module (Sim 900). 
This program calculates the amount of money related to the number of pulses.
Further we can modify it and use it to calculate the bill amount for electricity and directly send that bill to the mobile.
